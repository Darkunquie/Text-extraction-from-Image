# Text-extraction-from-Image
t preprocesses images using techniques like grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and skew correction before using Pytesseract to extract the text. It also localizes text within the image by drawing rectangles around detected characters or words. This project showcases an OCR pipeline for extracting text from various images.
